=head1 NAME

File::MMagic::XS - Guess File Type With XS (a la mod_mime_magic)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use File::MMagic::XS;

  my $m = File::MMagic::XS->new();
     $m = File::MMagic::XS->new('/etc/magic'); # use external magic file

  my $mime = $m->get_mime($file);

  # use File::MMagic compatible interface
  use File::MMagic::XS qw(:compat);

  my $m = File::MMagic::XS->new();
  $m->checktype_filename($file);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a port of Apache2 mod_mime_magic.c in Perl, written in XS with the
aim of being efficient and fast, especially for applications that need to be 
run for an extended amount of time.

There is a compatibility layer for File::MMagic. you can specify :compat
when importing the module

   use File::MMagic::XS qw(:compat);

And then the following methods are going to be available from File::MMagic::XS:

   checktype_filename
   checktype_filehandle
   checktype_contents
   addMagicEntry

Currently this software is in beta. If you have suggestions/recommendations 
about the interface or anything else, now is your chance to send them!

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(%args)

Creates a new File::MMagic::XS object.

If you specify the C<file> argument, then File::MMagic::XS will load magic
definitions from the specified file. If unspecified, it will use the magic
file that will be installed under File/MMagic/ directory.

=head2 clone()

Clones an existing File::MMagic::XS object.

=head2 parse_magic_file($file)

Read and parse a magic file, as used by Apache2.

=head2 get_mime($file)

Inspects the file specified by C<$file> and returns a MIME type if possible.
If no matching MIME type is found, then undef is returned.

=head2 fsmagic($file)

Inspects a file and returns a MIME type using inode information only. The
contents of the file is not inspected.

=head2 fhmagic($fh)

Inspects a file handle and returns a mime string by reading the contents
of the file handle.

=head2 ascmagic($file)

Inspects a piece of data (assuming it's not binary data), and attempts to
determine the file type.

=head2 bufmagic($scalar)

Inspects a scalar buffer, and attempts to determine the file type

=head2 add_magic($magic_line)

Adds a new magic entry to the object. The format of $magic_line is the same
as magic(5) file. This allows you to add custom magic entries at run time

=head2 add_file_ext($ext, $mime)

Adds a new file extension to MIME mapping. This is used as a fallback method
to determining MIME types. 

  my $magic = File::MMagic::XS->new;
  $magic->add_file_ext('t', 'text/perl-test');
  my $mime  = $magic->get_mime('t/01-sanity.t');

This will make get_mime() return 'text/perl-test'.

=head2 error()

Returns the last error string.

=head1 PERFORMANCE
